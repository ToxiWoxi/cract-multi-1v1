// In this file you can define some new custom round types.
//
// To enable the scout round example below, change the "enabled" setting from 0
// to 1.
//
// If a round type should not affect a player's rating set "ranked" to 0.
//
// If a round type should not have its own rating value, you can remove the
// "ratingFieldName" key, or set it to the empty string "".
//
// The "optional" key refers to it players have a choice whether the
// enable/disable it.
//
// You can not use more than one primary weapon and one secondary weapon in one
// round type.
//
// You can also use the weapon names "rifle_preference", "smg_preference",
// "shotgun_preference", and/or "pistol_preference" in the list of weapons, and
// the players will get the rifle, SMG, shotgun, or pistol they have selected.
